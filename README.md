	<h1>Snapie</h1>
	<p>Snapie is a Python script that uses the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) to automatically add bulk friends on Snapchat. Please note that using this script goes against Snapchat's terms of service and can result in account suspension or termination.</p>
  
<h2>Installation</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Clone the repository:</li>
	<pre>git clone https://github.com/krmdl/Snapie.git</pre>
	<pre>cd Snapie</pre>
	<li>Install the required libraries:</li>
	<pre>pip install -r requirements.txt</pre>
	<li>Connect an Android device with ADB and make sure that Snapchat is installed.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Open <code>main.py</code> and configure the bot settings, such as the number of friends to add, the delay between adding each friend, and the ADB device ID.</li>
	<li>Run the script:</li>
	<pre>python main.py</pre>
	<p>The script will automatically open Snapchat, log in to your account, and start adding friends.</p>
	<p><strong>Note:</strong> It's important to monitor the bot's activity and adjust the settings as necessary to avoid triggering Snapchat's anti-spam measures.</p>
</ol>
